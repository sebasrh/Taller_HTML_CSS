            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <div class = "steps">
                <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a bowl, add the flour and make a hole in the center. 
                                            Add half of the water, salt and extra virgin olive oil. 
                                            With a wooden spoon we begin to integrate the ingredients. 
                                            Dilute the baker's yeast in the rest of the water and add to the future dough. 
                                            It is advisable not to mix salt and yeast at the same time.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Salt can seriously disturb the action of yeast during the fermentation process. 
                                            The desirable level of salt in bread doughs ranges from 1.75% to 2.25%. 
                                            In this case we have opted for 8 grams so that it does not affect the leavening process and at the same time adds the necessary flavor.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> We begin to knead the ingredients in the same bowl until we form a ball. 
                                            Transfer the dough to a work surface and continue kneading. 
                                            We will work the dough for about 10 to 12 minutes.
                </p>       
                <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> We choose the container that we will take to the oven and sprinkle it with flour. 
                                            Place the ball of dough and brush it with a little extra virgin olive oil. 
                                            With a sharp knife we make some cuts on the surface of our dough and sprinkle it with flour.          
                </p> 
                <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> We turn on the oven at 220º C with heat up and down. In other words, preheat the oven. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You will see that it is very easy. We are going to bake 40 minutes inside the Pyrex or oven-safe bowl and another 25 minutes outside (to brown the bread and make it look nice). 
                                            I'll tell you about it below. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> We leave the bread dough we have in the Pyrex or ovenproof bowl (covered with aluminum foil, you can see the photos of the step by step) in the center tray for about 40 minutes. 
                                            This is where our future bread is going to grow, it would be like the rest that it has not had out of the oven.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> At the end of these 40 minutes we remove the aluminum foil cover from the bread dough and put it back in the oven for another 25 minutes. 
                                            When we remove the foil we will see that the dough has risen but is still uncooked. 
                                            After 25 minutes we will have the bread roll cooked and light. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Remove it from the oven and let it cool before enjoying it. 
                                            If you are enthusiastic about the baking world but you don't dare because it seems too difficult, you can start with this recipe.

            <div class = "steps">
                <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat the oven to 180ºC.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Beat the butter with the sugar until the mixture has the texture of a completely homogeneous cream.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add the sifted flour and the baking soda (which is optional but highly recommended) tablespoon by tablespoon as we mix everything.
                </p>       
                <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> We make balls and flatten them to shape the cookies about 6 cm wide and 3 mm thick. 
                                            We put them on parchment paper on a baking tray.          
                </p> 
                <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Bake for 12 minutes at 180ºC with heat up and down. 
                                            Make sure they do not overcook because each oven is different and if they are of different sizes they will need more or less time. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack for about 15 minutes.
